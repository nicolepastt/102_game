Summary: The company focused on rebranding itself to be a more functional and easy-to-navigate website. 
The company wanted more people of all ages to enjoy the website and see different kind of games. 
With an outstanding sum of more than $800,000 raised for the independent games, it is important to overall to increase exposure. 
On the website, users will be able to see the top funded game, and more funded games.

The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games or all games.

The following optional features are implemented: Changing the style of the font to make the website more easy to navigate and accessible, by using contrasting colors. I think with a website, one of the most important things to make sure is accessibility. Therefore making sure I used contrasting colors, with blues and text with black. The text on the website is aligned and centered. Adding in more CSS rules and customizing each of the headers was also done as well. The light-up effect when hovering over is added as well. Make sure the buttons work, to show the cards that apply to. Included the totals on the cards to display information that can be helpful to the user. A note for myself that I will continue working on is adding in more accessibility features, with websites I'd create I'd like to implement a way to use voice audio to pronounce the description as well.

Notes/Challenges: One challenge was going back to see what I did wrong, and trying to find more and more articles and videos that could help me achieve what was needed. 
The little errors were hard to catch. I came across concepts of Javascript that took me a while to understand but either way, it was great to challenge myself in doing more. 
I came across a lot of difficulties with my VSCode, pushing my code onto this repo, as my VSCode kept denying it. I forced pushed and it submitted the code through my other Github account which I don't use anymore and is not active. Setting up an account dedicated to completing this course and school-related courses was important to me.
